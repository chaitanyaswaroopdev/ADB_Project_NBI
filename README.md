# ADB_Project_NBI

### I worked on Project NBI, which stands for National Bridge Inventory, where we used Beekeeper Studio to write MySql Queries to find "Average age of Common Bridges of all years", "Count of Reconstructed", "Year Reconstructed & Year Built" from the last 15 years, i.e. from 2007 to 2015.
